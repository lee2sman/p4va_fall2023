# Programming for Visual Artists

[=> https://leetusman.com/p4va_fall2023](https://leetusman.com/p4va_fall2023)

Programming for Visual Artists is a foundation course in New Media that I teach at Purchase College. This is the fall 2023 edition. I have taught this several times but I try to keep it fresh each time, for me and the students.

I built this website using my jekyll website builder [minimal-uni](https://github.com/lee2sman/minimal-uni). Pages are generally added each week until the last week of the semester.
