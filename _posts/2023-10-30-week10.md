## Timers with millis()

p5.js has a single command for working with time:

```
millis()
```

millis() always returns the amount of *milliseconds* that have elapsed since your program started running.

```
print("it's been " + millis() + " seconds since our program started");
```

We can use *millis()* to create timers.

```
//check if it's been 3 seconds since our program started
if (millis() > 3000){
  //do something
}
```

We can make a repeating timer if it's in our draw and we increase the timer each time it's triggered. This is like the 'snooze' feature on an alarm. It keeps adding a bit more time.

```
let timer = 3000;
if (millis() > timer){
  //do something
  timer+=3000; //add 3 more seconds to the timer each time it goes off
}
```

How would we have a random timer?

```
//pick a random time between 1 and 10 seconds
let timer = random(1000,10000); 

if (millis() > timer){
  //do something
}
```

## challenge: Ambient Music Generator

[Starter code](https://editor.p5js.org/2sman/sketches/FA8XATe3q)

Goal: create an ambient sound generator.

Use a timer. Have a random sound get selected when timer goes off and play that sound.

> “One of the notes repeats every 23 1/2 seconds. It is in fact a long loop running around a series of tubular aluminum chairs in Conny Plank’s studio. The next lowest loop repeats every 25 7/8 seconds or something like that. The third one every 29 15/16 seconds or something. What I mean is they all repeat in cycles that are called incommensurable — they are not likely to come back into sync again.” — Brian Eno

Method:

"Read" or view the selections from Taper above. Read about Taper. Read the article about Nick Montfort, founder of Taper. Are there particular pieces you like? Think about how some of these are made. If you are completely uncertain, look at *everything gets eaten* linked above. That one you should definitely be able to figure out an idea of how the code works. 

After reading (playing?) all of the above computational works, now design an experimental computational poem-artwork. 

- What is the title?
- What is the concept?
- You may want to plan with a sketch on paper first

Turn in:
- Title
- Short description (up to 1 paragraph)
- Link to piece working fullscreen
- Link to code
