  # Programming For Visual Artists
  
  Programming for Visual Artists introduces code as a medium to create interactive visual art. Students explore the evolving history of new media and software art and are encouraged to push the edges of art into new and unknown territory. The course is taught with p5.js, a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else. We will study a diverse community of artists and approaches, and we will take an expansive view of how programming can be used as a tool to create new forms of art. Outside of class, students will have weekly readings, video tutorials, writing prompts and programming assignments. The goal is to be able to get to a level of proficiency where code becomes a tool for you to make art and to integrate into your total artistic practice.

  Taught by [Lee Tusman](http://leetusman.com).
